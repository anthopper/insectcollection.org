Welcome to the <a href="http://insectcollection.org">University of Minnesota Insect Collection and Virtual Insects Resource</a>. This website serves as the entry to interacting with the more than 3.75 million specimens retained in the University of Minnesota Insect research collection (UMSP). This resource was made possible in part, by two National Science Foundation (<a href="http://nsf.gov/">NSF</a>) grants awarded to the UMSP for digitization, mobilization, and discovery of the insect biodiversity retained in the UMSP insect research collection (<a href="http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1132188&amp;WT.z_pims_id=5448">NSF DBI-1132188</a> and <a href="http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1114845&amp;WT.z_pims_id=503559">NSF EF-1114845</a>). The ongoing support of the University of Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station (AES), as well as that of the <a href="http://www.entomology.umn.edu/">Department of Entomology</a>, is likewise gratefully acknowledged.

The UMSP Insect Collection began in 1879, with accessions of insects and spiders from the North Shore of Lake Superior. Over the past 132 years, the collection's holdings have grown from a regional reference resource of approximately 3,000 specimens, to a major national and international resource of more than 3.75 million specimens. As of December 2010, the collection was censused at <strong style="text-decoration: underline">3,750,369 curated specimens</strong>. This total currently represents <span style="text-decoration: underline">2,099</span> primary types (individual name-bearing specimens), <span style="text-decoration: underline">42,685 secondary types</span>, and a total of <strong style="text-decoration: underline">50,091</strong> described species of insects and related arthropods.

Digitization and computerization of preserved insect specimens retained in the UMSP is currently under way, utilizing several novel digital image acquisition methods, automated capture and batch processing of all data associated with the retained specimens, and electronic (WWW) access to this invaluable scientific, educational, and enduring resource. This website provides discovery and access to the UMSP specimens directly from the digital images, in a "zoomable" discovery format, as well as access to the digital specimen &amp; data repository for discovery, aggregation, and utilization of specimens and associated data.
